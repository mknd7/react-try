This here is my first try with React, after going through a quick read from the official docs (upto chapter 6 probably).

I've had experience with Emotion (CSS-in-JS) previously (although that was the framework-agnostic package; using React-specific @emotion/core now).
Combined with the brilliant bundler Parcel, it came in useful for rapid styling and prototyping.
